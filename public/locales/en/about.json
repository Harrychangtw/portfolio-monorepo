  "bio1": "Hi, I'm Harry Chang 👋🏻 — a curious traveler exploring uncharted territories through code, stories, and imagination. Whether journeying through books, films, or foreign cities, I seek to boldly go where no one has gone before.",
  "bio2": "My interests span AI research, filmmaking, and debating. Currently in 12th grade at Chingshin Academy in Taipei, Taiwan, I balance academics with pursuing unconventional projects that fascinate me. But beyond the code and cameras, I believe the best creations are those that solve problems and open doors for others.",
  "bio3": "I collect experiences like stamps in a passport, sharing discoveries with everyone I meet along the way. From LEGO mechanisms at age 4 to LLM safety research today, I remain that wide-eyed wanderer, forever asking: \"What lies beyond the next frontier?\"",
