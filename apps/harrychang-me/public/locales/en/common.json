We build not to challenge the divine, but to measure our own reach. It represents the audacity to construct languages, systems, and narratives that bridge the gap between the earth we walk on and the ideals we dream of.",

To code, to capture, and to create is to risk a magnificent failure in pursuit of a singular breakthrough. I would rather scorch my wings against the sun than never leave the ground, for the view from the ascent is worth the fall.",
